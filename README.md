Global Renewable energy production
The Renewable Energy Dashboard  unifies and visualizes disparate data sets related to renewable energy sources. It provides a comprehensive overview of energy production and consumption, enabling data-driven insights and optimization of renewable energy utilization.
Since the Industrial Revolution, the energy mix of most countries across the world has become dominated by fossil fuels. This has major implications for the global climate, as well as for human health.
To reduce CO2 emissions and local air pollution, the world needs to rapidly shift towards low-carbon sources of energy – nuclear and renewable technologies.
